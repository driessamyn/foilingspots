## Description

By the [Minster Windsurf Academy](https://minsterwindsurf.com/), this place is usually busy with a friendly crowd of wind and kite surfers as well as wing foilers.

Being part of the Thames estuary, even though the sea can get a bit choppy, the waves are usually not so big and there isn't much of a swell.

Easy to park and rig up along the pebble beach.

## Conditions

All directions from NW to NE are good. NW is a bit off-shore and there can be a bit of a wind shadow in this direction.
A low tide, you need to wade quite far to get enough depth for the foil, but it is possible.

## Parking

Plenty of free parking.
