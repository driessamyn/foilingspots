## Description

Home of the [Foiling Collective](https://www.thefoilingcollective.com/) school and shop, there are usually a few friendly wing foilers at this beach when the conditions are right.
The beach is shielded a bit, which means the sea is often flatter than in neighbouring foiling spots of St Mary's Bay or Hythe and a great spot to learn and practice.

## Conditions

Best in S to SW (cross, cross/off) and suitable 2 hours of high tide.

## Parking

Parking is easy, but paid for on the Ringgo app.
Rigging up is easy on the Pebble Beach.
