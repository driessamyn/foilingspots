## Description

Between Rudkøbing harbour and the bridge, this sheltered water is idea for learning.
You can rig up in the grass area and launch from the Row club bridge.

The water is quite shallow, but it works for me with a 75cm mast at High Tide.

WARNING: stay away from the start of the bridge as the current gets very strong there.
